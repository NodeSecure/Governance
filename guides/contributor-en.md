# **Guide for contributors (English)**

You are a developer and you want to **invest in an open source project**? Then this guide is for you.

By coming to contribute your objectives can be multiple:

- Improve your skills and knowledge.
- Collaborate with other individuals on a serious project.
- Help improve security in the JavaScript ecosystem and Node.js.
- Design and implement tools for devs.

You may very well be **a beginner**. Even if security is not your domain **it is not a problem either** (we have a lot of topics that do not require any security knowledge).

> 👀 Be careful not to make the decision on a whim. Take the time to think about at least one weekend.

## **Where to start 🐤 ?**

There is no ultimate answer and everyone will have different needs and level.

Here's what I can recommend;

- Take the time to discover and use our tools, **read the codes**.
- Read the NodeSecure articles on [dev.to](https://dev.to/nodesecure) to better understand the project.
- Join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/4Wn8rjAtB4) to chat, **ask your questions** and simply follow the different topics.
- Check out the task listing to see if you can already contribute: https://github.com/orgs/NodeSecure/projects/1

It is normal at first to be a little lost and not feel able to contribute (Knowing that simple subjects have a tendency to leave very quickly). If you are motivated enough do not hesitate to hang on and ask us for help.

## **How do we work?**

To date, we do not have any particular organization (each has different constraints). We have recently been trying to organize meetings to discuss among ourselves the various topics in progress and to come.

Everyone is therefore free **to define a rhythm of contribution that suits him**. Don't feel guilty or undeserving if you have less time and energy available than others to contribute.

The most important thing is to communicate on the Discord. If you can't finish a task, think about letting it be known to allow another person to contribute (and don't feel guilty about not being able to finish).

## **Where do we need help?**

Beyond open issues there are many things that do not require code. For example;

- UI/UX designer to design interfaces and visuals.
- Communication manager (to attract new users and contributors).

Obviously the Discord also serves as a place to discuss our different ideas and needs. Sometimes these can be opportunities for new contributors.
