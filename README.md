NodeSecure Governance (Code of conduct &amp; Contribution guidelines)

## Introduction
NodeSecure is a CLI that will fetch and deeply analyze the dependency tree of a given npm package (Or a local project with a package.json) and output a .json file that will contains all metadata and flags about each packages.

The CLI is able to open the JSON and draw a Network of all dependencies (UI and emojis flags will help you to identify potential issues and security threats).
